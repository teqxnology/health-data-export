Health Data Export helps you export your health information from Health Connect to your Google Sheets account and/or to CSV files on your device.
1) Information We Collect
a) Health data (via Health Connect)

If you grant permission, the app can read health data from Health Connect, such as:

    Activity (e.g., steps, distance, calories, exercise sessions)
    Body measurements (e.g., weight, body fat, height)
    Sleep information
    Vitals (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose), if you enable and export them
    Nutrition and cycle tracking data, if you enable and export them

We do not collect or receive this health data on our own servers. Health data is processed on your device and exported only to destinations you choose (e.g., your Google Sheet).
b) Google account information

If you connect Google, the app uses Google Sign-In to access your Google account for the purpose of exporting data to Google Sheets.

The app may access:

    Your selected Google account email address (to identify the signed-in account)
    Permission to create/update spreadsheets you select

c) App settings and preferences (stored locally)

The app stores certain settings on your device, such as:

    Which data types you selected for export
    Spreadsheet ID (if entered)
    Export frequency settings (if enabled)
    Last export timestamps
    Purchase status/entitlement (if you purchase premium features)

These settings are stored locally on your device.
d) Billing information (Premium feature)

If you purchase premium features (such as Auto Export), purchases are processed by Google Play Billing. We do not receive your payment card information. Google may share limited purchase status information (e.g., whether the purchase is active) with the app to enable the feature.
2) How We Use Information

We use the information described above to:

    Read health data from Health Connect (only when you grant permission)
    Export that data to your Google Sheet or CSV files
    Display export status and last export times
    Enable premium features you have purchased
    Improve app stability (e.g., showing errors if export fails)

3) Data Sharing and Disclosure
a) Google Sheets (your account)

If you use the Google Sheets export feature, data is sent to Google and stored in the spreadsheet you specify, under your Google account, subject to Google’s privacy policy and account settings.
b) No sale of personal data

We do not sell your personal data or health data.
c) No third-party analytics by default

We do not share your health data with third-party analytics or advertising networks.
4) Data Storage and Retention

    Health data is processed on-device and exported to your chosen destination.
    The app stores settings locally on your device until you uninstall the app or clear app data.
    Exported data remains in your Google Sheet and/or CSV files until you delete it.

5) Your Choices and Controls

You can:

    Grant or revoke Health Connect permissions at any time in Health Connect settings
    Disconnect your Google account using your device’s Google account settings or by revoking access in your Google Account
    Delete exported spreadsheets/rows and CSV files at any time
    Uninstall the app to remove locally stored preferences

6) Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the app. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are responsible for securing access to your device and your Google account.
7) Children’s Privacy

This app is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
8) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice within the app or on the store listing.
